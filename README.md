 ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

**Welcome to my [Data Analyst Portfolio](https://nijnij.github.io/JovanaNikolic.github.io/)** !

## About

My name is Jovana, and welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio! I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physical Chemistry and I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Physical Chemistry with a focus on Materials Science. Recently, I've also found myself drawn to the world of data analytics and I decided to delve deeper into that interest. Through this platform, you can explore the projects I've worked on, as I continue to nurture my growing interest in the field and continuously enhance my skills and knowledge. Hope you enjoy!

## Portfolio Projects

In this section you can find a list of data analytics projects I've completed so far, each with a brief description, linked code, as well as the technologies and the skills applied.


### Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
**Code:** [`Nashville Housing Data Cleaning.sql`](https://github.com/nijnij/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20Portfolio%20Project.sql)

**Description:** The dataset consists of houses sold in Nashville from 2013 to 2019. The project includes steps such as data loading, data cleaning and data preprocessing.

**Skills:** DML (Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language)

**Technology:** SQL Server


### COVID 19 Data Exploration
**Code:** [`COVID 19 Data Exploration.sql`](https://github.com/nijnij/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/COVID%20Portfolio%20Project%201.sql)

**Description:** The dataset consists of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021 period. The project included steps such as: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

**Technology:** SQL Server



### Movie Correlation
**Code:** [`Movie Correlation.ipynb`](https://github.com/nijnij/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Movie%20Correlation%20Portfolio%20Project.ipynb)

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022, which consisted of movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other information. The project included steps such as data loading, data cleaning, data preprocessing, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implementing Pearsonâ€™s correlation statistical analysis. Python functions were used to reveal that votes and budget had the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company had no significant correlation.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Correlation Matrices, Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
